In this extensive data analysis project, I thoroughly examined the stock market data of the top 100 companies listed in BSE over the past six months. I started by retrieving and collecting the data using Beautiful Soup and Selenium, enabling a detailed exploration. Using univariate analysis, I studied the distribution of companies in each sector and analyzed the average opening and closing prices for each sector.
Next, I performed a historical performance analysis, where I calculated the average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of daily stock values for each company. This analysis provided insights into the overall performance and volatility of these companies' stocks. Additionally, I utilized Bollinger Bands and Fibonacci Retracement analyses to identify potential buy and sell signals from the stock price graphs.
The project also involved identifying the best-performing and underperforming companies based on their stock values. I used metrics such as percentage change and ranking to determine the outstanding performers and companies facing challenges over the specified period. Moreover, I plotted the 7-day and 50-day moving averages to gain insights into the trends for these companies.
In addition to analyzing individual companies, I also explored the performance of sectors. I calculated the average opening and closing prices for each sector and compared them to identify potential trends.Â 
In addition to analyzing individual companies, I also explored the performance of sectors. I calculated the average opening and closing prices for each sector and compared them to identify potential trends. Furthermore, I visualized the percentage change in closing prices for each sector over the six-month period.
Finally, I delved into the correlation between companies within the same sector and the same group. By creating correlation heatmaps, I visually presented the strength of relationships between companies' closing prices. This analysis allowed investors to understand how stocks within a sector or group tend to move in relation to one another.
Overall, this project has provided a comprehensive understanding of the top 100 companies' stock market data. Through various analyses and visualizations, it has empowered investors to make more informed decisions, identify potential trends, and recognize correlations within the stock market. With the knowledge gained from this analysis, investors can now strategize and allocate their resources wisely to maximize returns in the dynamic and ever-changing stock market.
